/*Design document: Decompose your project into at least three parts(for ex. main, computerMove, chooseNumber) explain the functionality 	for each part. Design your method: name, input (parameters), output (return type).
Three Parts of the Project 
1. Main method
-Functionality: use initialGames and calculatePulls method, mainly the place for implementing the methods
-input (parameter): methods: initialGames and calculatePulls
-retern type: determined by the methods
2. initialGames method
-Functionality: (1) tell the player what this game is about (2) ask the player for input (go first or the total number of candies in the pile.)
-input (parameter): no parameter
-return type: void
3. calculatePulls method
-Functionality: calcuate the computer's move after the player moved
-input (parameter): int leftOver, int numberOfPulls
-return type: int
4. startGame method
-Functionality: process the player's response
-input (parameter): int leftOver, int numberOfPulls, Scanner sc
=return type: void

/*The algorithm is based on the truth table at every spot
here is the truth table 
Number of candy left after the player choosed 
		1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8
ComputerT	T	T	F	T	T	T	F
Player  F	F	F	T	F	F	F	T
Therefore, when baseOfDecision (leftOver%(numberOfPulls+1)) is equal to 1~3, then choose the number of reminder will guarantee success
However, when it lands on 4, then the computer has to random the number (between 1~3), and wait for the player to accidentally lands on 4
Therefore, if I want to make the computer wins everyone of the game if the play choose no initially, the total number should be set where when total % 4 = 1, 2, or 3, where the first pull will be these numbers (reminder of the division)
